### Hey, I'm Kurt André Lund!

I'm currently a student who's about to graduate from Noroff's Front-end Developer studies, I'm based in Sandnes, Norway.

After being a electrician for years i finally decided to develop myself in a field i love, developing. I started at Noroff with their Front-end studies which have been alot of fun and learning!
Late 2022 i met Mike Glabay from Glabay Studios, and have been working with him with various projects to learn Java and spring boot, and Python is on the to do list. 

I love learning new stuff, thats what i do, suck up knowledge and then use creatively. 

### What i'm currently learning

- Learning Java and spring boot, still pretty basic.
- Improving my react skills.


### What can i?

- Html, css and javscript ofcourse.
- React and Next.js with room for improvements.
- Bootstrap
- Adobe XD
